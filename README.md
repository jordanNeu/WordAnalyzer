# WordAnalyzer
Java program that scans a document and lists the top 20 words used


Written Plan:
Write a program that reads in a .txt document and pulls from it all of the words used,
minus punctuation.
It will utilize a HashMap to store the Strings and an integer to count the amount of times
the word was used.
The program will use a Scanner to read each line and record the word
Once the document is read I will need a LinkedHashMap to sort the results in descending order.
